// There is no difference between the typename and class keywords in this context. 
//You will often see people use the class keyword since it was introduced into the language earlier. 
//However, we prefer the newer typename keyword, because it makes it clearer that the type template parameter can be replaced by any type (such as a fundamental type), not just class types.

template<class s>
void fn(s t){
	cout<<t;
}

int main(){
	fn("rohit");
}

When the compiler encounters the function call max<int>(1, 2), it will determine that a function definition for max<int>(int, int) does not already exist. Consequently, the compiler will use our max<T> function template to create one.

The process of creating functions (with specific types) from function templates (with template types) is called function template instantiation (or instantiation for short). When this process happens due to a function call, itâ€™s called implicit instantiation. An instantiated function is often called a function instance (instance for short) or a template function. Function instances are normal functions in all regards.

#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
T max(T x, T y)
{
    return (x < y) ? y : x;
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << max<int>(1, 2) << '\n'; // instantiates and calls function max<int>(int, int)

    return 0;
}


________________________________________________________________


//instantiation happens like, function template instantiaition
template<class s>
void fn(s t){
	cout<<t;
}

//becomes:
template<class s>
void fn(s t);

template<>
void fn<int>(int t){
	cout<<t;
}

int main(){
	fn<int>(2);
}
