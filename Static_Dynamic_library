Static library : compiled and linked directly to the program, feels like written part of your source code. 
Windows: .lib file
linux: .a file

Part of executable, so its heavy. Always need vesion of library with your program.

Dynamic library : routines that are loaded into application during runtime, doesnt become part of the program. Since not llinked to your program hence they need to explicitly loaded and interfaced with program.
Windows: .dll file
linux: .so file

Many Programs share one copy of the library hence space is saved. They can be upgraded without replacing all of the executables that use it.

How to use:
Download the rpm(linux) or zip(Windows)
Install. Put the header and lib files in proper places, Link those files.
